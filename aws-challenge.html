<ol>
<li>
<p>First you need to click the button &quot;Create a Free Account&quot; from this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&amp;all-free-tier.sort-order=asc">url</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then you will need to fill a form with the following information</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Email address.</li>
<li>Password.</li>
<li>Confirm password.</li>
<li>AWS account name.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now you need to choose between a profesional or a personal account. It doesn't really matter which account type you select, they both have access to the same services. So you can choose personal and put your personal information.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Full name.</li>
<li>Phone number.</li>
<li>Country/Region.</li>
<li>Address.</li>
<li>City.</li>
<li>State/Province or Region.</li>
<li>Postal Code.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>You will have to put your credit card information now, you need to know that you can use the free tier and as long as you stay within the restrictions of the free tier you will not be charged. But if you exceed the restrictions of the free tier, there will be costs for that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you put your credit card number you need to confirm your indentity, so you will need to choose between having a call or getting a text message. You will need to put a four digit number and then click continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this step you can choose the appropiate support plan based on what you need. If you are starting I recommend you to choose the basic plan which is included for free with all types of accounts, sadly with this plan we won't get much in the way of support, so we will need to go to forums and other resources but AWS isn't going to directly support me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can check the AWS documentation about the free tier <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-limits.html">here</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
